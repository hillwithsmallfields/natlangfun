  "Describe a language which in the reference language is called
  @var{language-name}.

  If @var{language-name} is a list, it describes the language's place in
  the tree of languages, with the specific language name coming first
  and increasingly broad language families following.

  The language's own name for itself is @var{own-name} (which, like the
  reference name, may be a list; it, or any components of it, may be
  arrays consisting of the word in the language's script and a
  transliteration into Latin script).

  If a name or name component will be read by Scheme as a symbol, it may
  be given as a Scheme symbol.  Otherwise, it should be given as a
  string.

  The language's ISO 639-3 code is given as @var{code}.

  The writing systems are described by @var{scripts}, which is a list of
  lists of script-type and script-name.  If a third element is given for
  a script description, it is a vector containing the characters used in
  that script, in their conventional sorting order for that language, as
  strings, with symbols that share a place in the sorting order grouped
  in square brackets in the same string."
