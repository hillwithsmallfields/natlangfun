Natural language description using functional programming

A project to describe natural languages using a functional language
(clojure).

I hope to be able to generate phrases and sentences with correct
grammar, from function calls that describe the structure of the
desired utterance.

It should also be possible to generate language descriptions similar
to those that occur in the reference chapters of self-study books.  I
had long intended to write a system for doing this, using XML and
XSLT, but they're such clumsy tools compared with Scheme.

This is part of my plan to learn several natural languages in
parallel.  Using descriptions like this should force me to be
systematic in making notes as I learn them.
